Built for me a chatbot UI, here are the features wanted:

1. User must set their baseURL, api key, and models at the first place. (sidebar, dialog, whatever).
2. The provider could be from any as long as they support OpenAPI specification. e.g sumpod, openrouter, aistudio.google.com, etc.
3. The API is ready, but you could refactor it to make it better. API /api/chat
4. The UI should use streamChat and use openai.chat(model) not openai.completion(model) AND/OR openai.response(model) AND/OR openai(model).
5. The UI should also gives good UX by shows the step, e.g: tool call, reasoning/thinking.
6. User can retry, cancel/abort, clear chat, edit prompt (only latest prompt).
7. The chat UI should have branch. The Branch component manages multiple versions of AI messages, allowing users to navigate between different response branches. It provides a clean, modern interface with customizable themes and keyboard-accessible navigation buttons.
9. Prompt input UI could only take text input.
10. The UI should have a suggestion prompt at the first place.
11. The UI should built using MUI and TailwindCSS.
12. The Chat persist, when user create a new chat, rewrite the page to /:id gracefully, make sure to not error
